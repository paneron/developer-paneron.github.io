              aligns with ISO 19135-1 register schema.

              Registry kit defines a model for expressing ISO 19135-1 register
              data as a collection of YAML files, and simplifies creating
              Paneron extensions that work with that data.

                  Registry kit is currently under active development, and some
                  of its features may be incomplete.

              Instead of writing your own repository view component from
              scratch, with the registry kit you can import its registry view
              component, and pass it a configuration of register item classes
              that your register supports.

              Registry kit would then handle the general aspects of registers,
              such as item IDs, statuses, change request flow and more. It would
              also handle the low-level interaction with repository data, such
              as reading and reading files. Your extension’s responsibility is
              thus just significantly reduced: right now it’s mostly providing
              UI components for displaying and editing register item data that
              is specific to your item classes.
