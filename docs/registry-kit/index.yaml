              Registry kit defines a model for expressing ISO 19135-1 register
              data as a collection of YAML files, and simplifies creating
              Paneron extensions that work with that data.

              Instead of writing your own repository view component from
              scratch, with Registry kit you can import its registry view and
              pass it a description of item classes that your register supports
              with.
